# Subscription

Julia's hosted models are offered via subscription to Julia Pro or Julia Business.

> Using [your own API keys](./llm-providers.md), and [external agents](./external-agents.md), is _free_ — you do not need to subscribe to a Julia plan to use AI features.

See the following pages for specific aspects of our subscription offering:

- [Models](./models.md): Overview of the models offered by Julia's subscriptions.

- [Plans and Usage](./plans-and-usage.md): Outlines Julia's plans and how usage is measured.

- [Billing](./billing.md): Billing policies and procedures, and how to update or view various billing settings.
