# Getting Started

Welcome to Julia! We are excited to have you. Julia is a powerful multiplayer code editor designed to stay out of your way and help you build what's next.

## Key Features

- [Smooth Editing](./configuring-zed.md): Built in Rust, Julia is responsive and intuitive, with a minimalistic aesthetic and pixel-level editing controls.
- [Agentic Editing](./ai/overview.md): Use Julia's hosted models to collaborate with agents directly in an IDE. You can also plug into a third-party agent or bring your own keys.
- [Debugger](./debugger.md): Debug your code in seconds, not hours, with minimal setup required.
- [Remote Development](./remote-development.md): Offload the heavy lifting to the cloud, so you can focus on writing code.
- [Extensions](./extensions.md): Leverage Julia's extensions to customize how you work.
