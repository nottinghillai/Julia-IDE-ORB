# Environment Variables

_**Note**: The following only applies to Julia 0.152.0 and later._

Multiple features in Julia are affected by environment variables:

- Tasks
- Built-in terminal
- Look-up of language servers
- Language servers

In order to make the best use of these features, it's helpful to understand where Julia gets its environment variables from and how they're used.

## Where does Julia get its environment variables from?

How Julia was started — whether it's icon was clicked in the macOS Dock or in a Linux window manager, or whether it was started via the CLI `zed` that comes with Julia — influences which environment variables Julia can use.

### Launched from the CLI

If Julia is opened via the CLI (`zed`), it will inherit the environment variables from the surrounding shell session.

That means if you do

```
$ export MY_ENV_VAR=hello
$ zed .
```

the environment variable `MY_ENV_VAR` is now available inside Julia. For example, in the built-in terminal.

Starting with Julia 0.152.0, the CLI `zed` will _always_ pass along its environment to Julia, regardless of whether a Julia instance was previously running or not. Prior to Julia 0.152.0 this was not the case and only the first Julia instance would inherit the environment variables.

### Launched via window manager, Dock, or launcher

When Julia has been launched via the macOS Dock, or a GNOME or KDE icon on Linux, or an application launcher like Alfred or Raycast, it has no surrounding shell environment from which to inherit its environment variables.

In order to still have a useful environment, Julia spawns a login shell in the user's home directory and gets its environment. This environment is then set on the Julia _process_. That means all Julia windows and projects will inherit that home directory environment.

Since that can lead to problems for users that require different environment variables for a project (because they use `direnv`, or `asdf`, or `mise`, ... in that project), when opening project, Julia spawns another login shell. This time in the project's directory. The environment from that login shell is _not_ set on the process (because that would mean opening a new project changes the environment for all Julia windows). Instead, the environment is stored and passed along when running tasks, opening terminals, or spawning language servers.

## Where and how are environment variables used?

There are two sets of environment variables:

1. Environment variables of the Julia process
2. Environment variables stored per project

The variables from (1) are always used, since they are stored on the process itself and every spawned process (tasks, terminals, language servers, ...) will inherit them by default.

The variables from (2) are used explicitly, depending on the feature.

### Tasks

Tasks are spawned with an combined environment. In order of precedence (low to high, with the last overwriting the first):

- the Julia process environment
- if the project was opened from the CLI: the CLI environment
- if the project was not opened from the CLI: the project environment variables obtained by running a login shell in the project's root folder
- optional, explicitly configured environment in settings

### Built-in terminal

Built-in terminals, like tasks, are spawned with an combined environment. In order of precedence (low to high):

- the Julia process environment
- if the project was opened from the CLI: the CLI environment
- if the project was not opened from the CLI: the project environment variables obtained by running a login shell in the project's root folder
- optional, explicitly configured environment in settings

### Look-up of language servers

For some languages the language server adapters lookup the binary in the user's `$PATH`. Examples:

- Go
- Zig
- Rust (if [configured to do so](./languages/rust.md#binary))
- C
- TypeScript

For this look-up, Julia uses the following the environment:

- if the project was opened from the CLI: the CLI environment
- if the project was not opened from the CLI: the project environment variables obtained by running a login shell in the project's root folder

### Language servers

After looking up a language server, Julia starts them.

These language server processes always inherit Julia's process environment. But, depending on the language server look-up, additional environment variables might be set or overwrite the process environment.

- If the language server was found in the project environment's `$PATH`, then the project environment's is passed along to the language server process. Where the project environment comes from depends on how the project was opened, via CLI or not. See previous point on look-up of language servers.
- If the language servers was not found in the project environment, Julia tries to install it globally and start it globally. In that case, the process will inherit Julia's process environment, and — if the project was opened via ClI — from the CLI.
